# Contributing to Energy Optimisation

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Energy Optimisation. It's people like you that make Energy Optimisation such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork and create a branch with a descriptive name.

### Get the test suite running
Make sure you have the development requirements installed and the test suite running. It's much easier to find bugs, fix them and check that your fixes have worked if you can reliably tell what's broken.

### Implement your fix or feature
At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

### Make a Pull Request
At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's up to date with Energy Optimisation's master branch

### Keeping your Pull Request updated
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

### Merging a PR (maintainers only)
A PR can only be merged into master by a maintainer if:

- It is passing CI.
- It has been approved by at least two maintainers. If it was a maintainer who opened the PR, only one extra approval is needed.
- It has no requested changes.
- It is up to date with current master.
